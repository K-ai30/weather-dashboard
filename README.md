# Weather Dashboard

### Description

An Introduction to Server-Side APIs

This application was created using a Server-Side API (OpenWeather Map) to call current weather data and a five day weather forecast for end users to plan their day according to the weather in their current city or desired location.  The challenge with this project was in parsing the data to reflect the information needed to display in the application.

### Technologies Utilized:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap 4
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* AJAX

### Features Included:

The user can plan their day according to the weather with the following triggered effects:

- Search by City
- Current weather
- 5 day forecast
- Current Date stamp
- Temperature
- Humidity
- UV Index severity

Additional features include the option of saving the city search list items to local storage for later retrieval and use as a button to refer back to recent search history.

### Notes

I started building this application for an end-user in an effort to provide a solution to needing a daily weather forecast. To that end, I hope to achieve some future dated development ideas that will enhance the user engagement with the application.
